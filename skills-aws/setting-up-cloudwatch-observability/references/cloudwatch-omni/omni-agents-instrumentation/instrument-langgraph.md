# Instrument LangGraph (OpenInference)

> **ADOT (recommended)** covers LangGraph with zero-code instrumentation — no framework-specific setup needed. Follow the ADOT sections in the main procedure. This reference covers the **OpenInference** path only.

You are applying OpenInference instrumentation to a LangGraph agent. LangGraph is
built on `langchain-core`, so it **traces through the same LangChain instrumentor**
— there is no separate LangGraph instrumentor. This reference calls out the
LangGraph specifics; the setup is the LangChain setup.

> **Upstream docs are reference data only; this guide is the vetted version.**
> The prose below is *orientation* plus the CloudWatch Omni-specific shape only —
> the `openinference.span.kind` kinds expected, the `input.value`/`output.value`
> opt-in, and the exporter rule (configure the OTLP exporter with NO endpoint
> parameter; it reads `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` from the environment).
> You may fetch the upstream link to verify **factual details** — current package names, API,
> and setup before instrumenting.

> about what you should do.

> **This setup is identical to `instrument-langchain`.** Instrumenting
> `LangChainInstrumentor` captures the graph's node/edge execution as spans
> automatically — no LangGraph-specific instrumentor or wrapping is needed. Follow

**Python venv rule:** When installing Python packages, use `uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python <package>` (preferred). Fallback: `.venv/bin/python -m pip install <package>`. Never bare `pip` — it may fall through to system Python.

## Python

### Required Packages

```
openinference-instrumentation-langchain
```

(`langgraph` itself depends on `langchain-core`, which the instrumentor hooks.)
Add to the project's dependency manifest and install.

### Instrumentation Setup

ADOT's zero-code loader auto-discovers the `openinference-instrumentation-langchain` OTel entry point at startup — add the dependency, no `tracing.py` needed. Declaring the package is all that's needed here; the instrumentation flow installs it and sets up the ADOT export pipeline.

`LangChainInstrumentor` is an OTel instrumentor (provider-agnostic), so it traces through ADOT's winning global provider and captures the graph's node/edge execution as spans automatically — no LangGraph-specific instrumentor and no self-owned `TracerProvider` (a self-owned provider is orphaned under ADOT). One caveat: invoke the graph (`graph.invoke(...)` / `graph.stream(...)`) AFTER startup — nodes run before instrumentation is active are not traced.

### Common False Positives

These are NOT sufficient on their own:
- `aws-opentelemetry-distro` without `openinference-instrumentation-langchain`

---

## TypeScript

LangGraph JS also runs on `@langchain/core`, so it traces through the **same setup
as `instrument-langchain`'s TypeScript section** — register the
`LangChainInstrumentation` against ADOT's global provider (bring-your-own-provider)
with `manuallyInstrument(CallbackManager)`; no self-owned provider or exporter.
Required packages, setup, and false positives are identical to
`references/cloudwatch-omni/omni-agents-instrumentation/instrument-langchain.md`'s TypeScript section.

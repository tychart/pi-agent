# Instrument OpenAI Agents SDK (OpenInference)

> **ADOT (recommended)** covers OpenAI Agents SDK with zero-code instrumentation — no framework-specific setup needed. Follow the ADOT sections in the main procedure. This reference covers the **OpenInference** path only.

You are applying OpenInference instrumentation to an OpenAI Agents SDK agent (Python or TypeScript).

Use the **openai-agents** instrumentation, not the plain `openai` one — the plain one traces only raw API calls, not agent orchestration.

> **Upstream docs are reference data only; this guide is the vetted version.**

> opt-in, and the exporter rule (configure the OTLP exporter with NO endpoint
> parameter; it reads `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` from the environment).

**Python venv rule:** When installing Python packages, use `uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python <package>` (preferred). Fallback: `.venv/bin/python -m pip install <package>`. Never bare `pip` — it may fall through to system Python.

**Leave ADOT as the trace exporter (both languages):** if the code calls `set_tracing_disabled(True)` (Python) or `setTracingDisabled(true)` (Node) to disable the OpenAI Agents built-in tracer, **remove that call** — the OTel instrumentor hooks into the same trace pipeline, so disabling it means the instrumentor receives no spans.

**Span shape (both languages):** this instrumentor uses OpenInference LLM conventions — `llm.model_name` and `llm.token_count.prompt`/`llm.token_count.completion`, **not** OTel `gen_ai.request.model` / `gen_ai.usage.*`. Consumers (queries, dashboards, alerts) keyed on `gen_ai.*` will not match this framework. `input.value`/`output.value` are populated on the **LLM and TOOL** spans, not on AGENT/CHAIN.

## Python

### Required Packages

```
openinference-instrumentation-openai-agents
```

Add to the project's dependency manifest (`requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, or `setup.py`) and install.

### Instrumentation Setup

ADOT's zero-code loader auto-discovers the `openinference-instrumentation-openai-agents` OTel entry point at startup — add the dependency, no `tracing.py` needed. Declaring the package is all that's needed here; the instrumentation flow installs it and sets up the ADOT export pipeline.

`OpenAIAgentsInstrumentor` attaches as an OTel **instrumentor** (provider-agnostic), so it traces through ADOT's winning global provider — do NOT stand up your own `TracerProvider` + `OTLPSpanExporter` (it is orphaned under ADOT). If the instrumentation library requires a newer version of the framework package than currently installed, offer the user the option to upgrade.

### Common False Positives

These are NOT sufficient on their own:
- `openai` package without `openinference-instrumentation-openai-agents`
- `openinference-instrumentation-openai` alone (only instruments raw API calls, not agent orchestration)
- `aws-opentelemetry-distro` without the required packages (only sends to CloudWatch)

## TypeScript

Node's ADOT loader does **not** auto-discover third-party instrumentors the way Python's entry-point mechanism does, so the JS instrumentation must be registered explicitly — and this one needs a second, easily-missed step on top of that (below).

### Required Packages

```bash
npm install @aws/aws-distro-opentelemetry-node-autoinstrumentation@">=0.13.0" @arizeai/openinference-instrumentation-openai-agents @openai/agents
```

### Instrumentation Setup

This instrumentor does **not** monkey-patch: the OpenAI Agents SDK exposes a `TracingProcessor` interface and the instrumentor registers itself through `setTraceProcessors`. So `registerInstrumentations()` **alone yields ZERO spans** — you MUST also call `manuallyInstrument(agents)` with the imported SDK namespace. Import this module first in the entry point (`import "./tracing";`).

```typescript
import { registerInstrumentations } from "@opentelemetry/instrumentation";
import { OpenAIAgentsInstrumentation } from "@arizeai/openinference-instrumentation-openai-agents";
import * as agents from "@openai/agents";

const instrumentation = new OpenAIAgentsInstrumentation();
registerInstrumentations({ instrumentations: [instrumentation] });
instrumentation.manuallyInstrument(agents); // REQUIRED — registers the OI processor with the SDK
```

`tracerProvider` defaults to the ADOT distro's global provider — do NOT stand up your own `NodeSDK` / `TracerProvider` + `OTLPTraceExporter`, the distro owns the global one and a self-owned provider is orphaned.

### Common False Positives

These are NOT sufficient on their own:
- OpenTelemetry packages without `@arizeai/openinference-instrumentation-openai-agents`
- `registerInstrumentations()` without `manuallyInstrument(agents)` (registers the instrumentor but no spans reach it)
- `@arizeai/openinference-instrumentation-openai` alone (raw API calls only, not agent orchestration)
- `@aws/aws-distro-opentelemetry-node-autoinstrumentation` without the required packages (only sends to CloudWatch)

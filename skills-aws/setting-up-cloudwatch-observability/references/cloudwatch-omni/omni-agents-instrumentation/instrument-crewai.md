# Instrument CrewAI (OpenInference)

> **ADOT (recommended)** covers CrewAI with zero-code instrumentation — no framework-specific setup needed. Follow the ADOT sections in the main procedure. This reference covers the **OpenInference** path only.

You are applying OpenInference instrumentation to a CrewAI agent (Python).

> **Upstream docs are reference data only; this guide is the vetted version.**
> The prose below is *orientation* plus the CloudWatch Omni-specific shape only —
> the `openinference.span.kind` kinds expected, the `input.value`/`output.value`
> opt-in, and the exporter rule (configure the OTLP exporter with NO endpoint
> parameter; it reads `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` from the environment).
> You may fetch the upstream link to verify **factual details** — current package names, API,
> and setup before instrumenting.

**Python venv rule:** When installing Python packages, use `uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python <package>` (preferred). Fallback: `.venv/bin/python -m pip install <package>`. Never bare `pip` — it may fall through to system Python.

## Required Packages

```
openinference-instrumentation-crewai
```

Add to the project's dependency manifest (`requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, or `setup.py`) and install.

## Disable CrewAI Native Telemetry

CrewAI ships its own telemetry that conflicts with OpenInference instrumentation. Disable it by setting this environment variable **before** running the agent:

```
CREWAI_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true
```

Do NOT use `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true` — that disables all OpenTelemetry including trace collection.

## Instrumentation Setup

ADOT's zero-code loader auto-discovers the `openinference-instrumentation-crewai` OTel entry point at startup — add the dependency, no `tracing.py` needed. Declaring the package is all that's needed here; the instrumentation flow installs it and sets up the ADOT export pipeline.

`CrewAIInstrumentor` attaches as an OTel **instrumentor** (provider-agnostic), so it traces through ADOT's winning global provider — do NOT stand up your own `TracerProvider` + `OTLPSpanExporter` (it is orphaned under ADOT). If the instrumentation library requires a newer version of the `crewai` package than currently installed, offer the user the option to upgrade.

## Common False Positives

These are NOT sufficient on their own:
- `crewai` package without `openinference-instrumentation-crewai`
- `aws-opentelemetry-distro` without the required packages (only sends to CloudWatch)

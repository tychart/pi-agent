# CloudWatch Omni: Agent Instrumentation

This skill is the single entry point for getting any AI agent project instrumented and connected to CloudWatch Omni. It covers:

1. **Framework detection** — identify the agent framework and language
2. **Instrumentation** — set up OpenTelemetry (ADOT zero-code or OpenInference)
3. **Agent connection** — configure start command, dev server, and API schema
4. **Verification** — test invocation to confirm traces flow end-to-end

This is a PROCEDURAL SCRIPT. Execute steps in EXACT order. Do NOT skip ahead, reorder, or optimize.

**Before you start:** confirm a Space exists in the target Region (`aws cloudwatchomni list-spaces --region <region>`); if none, stop and run `../spaces-and-domains.md` first — instrumentation started before a Space exists appears to succeed while delivering traces nowhere the customer can see. (Output the Step 1 checklist first; this probe is the first tool call after it.)

**A custom metric from the agent** (a latency histogram, a tokens-per-call counter) follows the same rule as any application: it must reach Omni as an OTLP metric carrying the agent's resource attributes — through the OTel Metrics API on the SDK this flow installs, or through a collector — and `PutMetricData`/EMF do not put it on Omni's PromQL surface. Answer from `../instrumentation/instrumentation.md` (§ Custom metrics); do not run the onboarding checklist for that question.

## Step 1 — Output checklist

Output this checklist to the user BEFORE doing any other work:

```markdown
I'll set up CloudWatch Omni for your project. Here's the plan:

## Onboarding Plan
- [ ] **Detect framework** — identify your AI framework and language
- [ ] **Instrument** — set up OpenTelemetry so your agent emits traces
- [ ] **Connect to agent**
  - [ ] Configure start command & start local server
  - [ ] Test invocation — run a test request and confirm a matching trace was captured

Let me start by scanning your project...
```

**Do NOT scan files, read dependencies, or call any other tools until you have output this checklist.**

## Rules for all phases

- Execute every phase below even if you believe steps were already completed.
- After completing each phase, reprint the checklist with updated checkmarks and a 1-2 sentence summary.
- Do NOT freelance — do not write instrumentation code without following the procedures below.

---

## Phase 1: Detect Framework and Platform

Identify the AI framework and language from the project's dependency files:
- Python: `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.py`
- TypeScript: `package.json`

Confirm by scanning source file imports.

### Detect AgentCore CLI platform

After identifying the framework and language, check whether this project uses the **new AgentCore CLI** (`agentcore dev`). The ONLY reliable signal is:
- An `agentcore/` directory containing `agentcore.json` at the project root

**Important:** The `bedrock-agentcore` Python package or `@aws/bedrock-agentcore` npm package alone does NOT mean the new CLI is in use — those are SDK dependencies that exist in both old-CLI and new-CLI projects. Only the `agentcore/agentcore.json` config file indicates the new CLI structure.

If `agentcore/agentcore.json` is present, set `platform` to `"agentcore"` (the AgentCore CLI is **Python-only**). Do NOT ask the user — auto-detect and proceed.

If NO AgentCore signals are found, set `platform` to `"generic"`. The start command will be the project's natural server command (e.g., `uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --reload`). Do NOT use the `opentelemetry-instrument` wrapper — hot-reload servers spawn child subprocesses; the wrapper only instruments the parent process; PYTHONPATH injection reaches all processes.

### If no agent project is detected (blank/empty folder)

If there are NO dependency files, NO source files with agent imports, and NO recognizable agent code, this is a blank project. **Do NOT continue searching for files that don't exist.** Instead, immediately tell the user:

> "This folder doesn't contain an AI agent project yet. Please open a folder that contains an existing agent project, or create one first."

Then STOP. Do NOT proceed with further phases if no framework was found.

### If an agent project IS detected

Report the detection (including platform) and persist it to `.omni/server-config.json`:
- Create `.omni/` directory if it doesn't exist
- Preserve any existing keys already in the file
- Set `framework`, `language`, and `platform`
- If the file does not exist yet, initialize it with:
  ```json
  {
    "platform": "<agentcore|generic>",
    "startCommand": "",
    "framework": "<name>",
    "language": "<lang>"
  }
  ```

Then reprint the checklist:

```markdown
Found **LangGraph** (Python) from your pyproject.toml imports. Platform: AgentCore CLI.

- [x] **Detect framework** — LangGraph / Python
- [ ] **Instrument** — set up OpenTelemetry
- [ ] **Connect to agent**
```

---

## Phase 2: Instrument

This phase sets up OpenTelemetry instrumentation so the agent emits traces that CloudWatch Omni can collect.

Always follow this phase even if instrumentation already appears present — it verifies the existing setup and asks the user whether to switch to ADOT.

### Step 2.1: Scan Dependencies

Search dependency files for telemetry signals. Do NOT install anything yet — only scan for package names.

**Python** — check `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`:

| Signal | Means |
|--------|-------|
| `aws-opentelemetry-distro` | ADOT installed |
| `openinference-instrumentation-*` | OpenInference installed |
| `langfuse`, `traceloop-sdk` | Third-party vendor |

**TypeScript** — check `package.json`:

| Signal | Means |
|--------|-------|
| `@aws/aws-distro-opentelemetry-node-autoinstrumentation` | ADOT installed |
| `@arizeai/openinference-*` | OpenInference installed |
| `langfuse`, `@vercel/otel` | Third-party vendor |

Record what you found. Move to Step 2.2.

### Step 2.2: Decide Approach (ALWAYS Ask Unless ADOT Present)

Based on scan results, follow ONE of these cases:

**Case A: ADOT already installed, no conflicts** — verify input/output attributes and agent step spans are configured. If all good, report completion with `approach: "adot"`. No user question needed.

> **Critical classification rule:** The ADOT distro alone does NOT mean ADOT is the span source — the distro can be present just to stand up the export pipeline while a third-party instrumentor generates the spans. If an OpenInference or Traceloop instrumentor is ALSO present (even alongside the ADOT distro), that instrumentor is the span source — this is NOT Case A, go to Case B.

**Case B: OpenInference or manual OTel found** — If Strands (TypeScript) or Vercel AI SDK (TypeScript): OpenInference is not supported — switch to ADOT, do not ask. For all other combos: present both options (ADOT recommended vs keep current). Wait for user answer. This is Case B even if the ADOT distro is also installed — ADOT distro is just the export pipeline, and the OpenInference instrumentor is still the span source.

**Case C: Third-party vendor found (Langfuse, Traceloop, Vercel OTel)** — If Strands (TypeScript) or Vercel AI SDK (TypeScript): proceed directly with ADOT, do not offer OpenInference. For all other combos: explain incompatibility, present ADOT vs OpenInference. Wait for user answer.

**Case D: Nothing found** — If Strands (TypeScript) or Vercel AI SDK (TypeScript): proceed directly with ADOT, do not offer OpenInference. For all other combos: present ADOT (recommended) vs OpenInference. Wait for user answer.

### Step 2.3: Execute Chosen Approach

#### ADOT (Zero-Code) — Python

> **Upstream reference (factual details only):** <https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/python-sdk/auto-instr>

1. **Remove only self-owned OTel setup — KEEP the framework's OpenInference instrumentor** — remove `opentelemetry-sdk`, `traceloop-sdk`, and self-owned tracing code (`TracerProvider` setup, `OTLPSpanExporter`/`SimpleSpanProcessor`, `tracing.py` files). Do **NOT** remove the detected framework's `openinference-instrumentation-<framework>` package (e.g. `openinference-instrumentation-langchain` for LangChain/LangGraph, `openinference-instrumentation-openai-agents` for OpenAI Agents). Under ADOT that instrumentor is still the span source — ADOT's zero-code loader auto-discovers its OTel entry point at startup, and `aws-opentelemetry-distro` **without** it emits zero LLM/agent spans (see the Case B rule above and the per-framework guide). Strip any bespoke `openinference` provider wiring inside `tracing.py`, but keep the instrumentor dependency itself.
2. **Add ADOT dependency** — `aws-opentelemetry-distro>=0.20.0` in requirements
3. **Install into venv** — `uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python "aws-opentelemetry-distro>=0.20.0" setuptools`
4. **Start command** — use PYTHONPATH injection (NOT `opentelemetry-instrument` wrapper):
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   export PYTHONPATH="$(python -c 'import opentelemetry.instrumentation.auto_instrumentation.sitecustomize as s; import os; print(os.path.dirname(s.__file__))')"${PYTHONPATH:+:$PYTHONPATH}
   export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:<OTLP_PORT>"
   export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="<agent-name>"
   python <entry-point>
   ```
   **Windows:** PYTHONPATH injection works the same way. If you must use programmatic loading instead (e.g., `execl()` breaks process tracking on Windows), add before any instrumented imports:
   ```python
   from opentelemetry.instrumentation.auto_instrumentation import initialize
   initialize()
   ```
5. **Add input/output attributes** in the request handler:
   ```python
   from opentelemetry import trace
   span = trace.get_current_span()
   span.set_attribute("input.value", user_prompt)
   span.set_attribute("output.value", agent_response[:4000])
   ```
6. **Add agent step spans (custom agents only)** — wrap orchestration steps with spans using `openinference.span.kind` attributes (`AGENT`, `LLM`, `RETRIEVER`, `TOOL`)

#### ADOT (Zero-Code) — TypeScript

> **Upstream reference (factual details only):** <https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/introduction>

1. **Set `OTEL_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE_LENGTH_LIMIT=65536`** — prevents truncation of large prompts. **Enforced — completion will be rejected without this.**
2. **Remove only self-owned OTel setup — KEEP the framework's `@arizeai/openinference-instrumentation-*` instrumentor AND its registration call** — remove the packages `@opentelemetry/sdk-node`, `@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base`, `@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http`, `@opentelemetry/resources`, `@vercel/otel` (keep `@opentelemetry/api`). Inside `tracing.ts`/`instrumentation.ts`, remove **only** the self-owned provider/exporter wiring — `NodeSDK` init, `registerOTel` against a self-owned provider, `OTLPTraceExporter` setup, `SimpleSpanProcessor` imports — but do **NOT** delete the file wholesale and do **NOT** remove the instrumentor's registration call. Unlike Python (where ADOT auto-discovers the instrumentor's OTel entry point with no wiring), the JS OpenInference instrumentors require an explicit registration call — e.g. `manuallyInstrument(CallbackManager)` / `registerInstrumentations(...)` — registered against ADOT's global provider (bring-your-own-provider). Keep both the `@arizeai/openinference-instrumentation-<framework>` package and that registration call; removing either leaves the instrumentor inert and ADOT emitting zero LLM/agent spans.
3. **Add ADOT dependency** — `@aws/aws-distro-opentelemetry-node-autoinstrumentation` (use `--legacy-peer-deps` for Strands)
4. **Verify ADOT supports your framework version** — check SUPPORTED_VERSIONS in the installed distro:
   ```bash
   grep -A 5 "SUPPORTED_VERSIONS" node_modules/@aws/aws-distro-opentelemetry-node-autoinstrumentation/build/src/patches/*.js
   ```
   ADOT silently won't attach outside supported ranges — you get HTTP spans but **no AGENT/LLM/TOOL spans and zero tokens, with no error**. If out of range, bump the framework to a supported version.
5. **Start command** (detect ESM vs CJS from `"type": "module"` in package.json):
   - CommonJS: `node --require @aws/aws-distro-opentelemetry-node-autoinstrumentation/register <entry-point>`
   - ESM: `node --experimental-loader=@opentelemetry/instrumentation/hook.mjs --import @aws/aws-distro-opentelemetry-node-autoinstrumentation/register <entry-point>`
   - With build step: prepend `npm run build &&`
6. **Add input/output attributes** in the request handler:
   ```typescript
   import { trace } from "@opentelemetry/api";
   const span = trace.getActiveSpan();
   span?.setAttribute("input.value", prompt);
   span?.setAttribute("output.value", result.slice(0, 4000));
   ```
7. **`@opentelemetry/api` version conflict** — if you see `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getActiveSpan')`, check for version duplication: `npm ls @opentelemetry/api`. Fix with `npm dedupe` or pin a single version in `package.json` resolutions.

#### OpenInference — Framework-Specific

Map the detected framework to its instrumentation package:

| Framework | Python Package | TypeScript Package |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| LangGraph/LangChain | `openinference-instrumentation-langchain` | `@arizeai/openinference-instrumentation-langchain` |
| Strands | `openinference-instrumentation-strands-agents` | — (OpenInference NOT supported on TS; use ADOT) |
| CrewAI | `openinference-instrumentation-crewai` | — |
| OpenAI Agents | `openinference-instrumentation-openai-agents` | `@arizeai/openinference-instrumentation-openai-agents` |
| Vercel AI | — | — (OpenInference NOT supported; use ADOT) |
| LlamaIndex | `openinference-instrumentation-llama-index` | — |
| Google ADK | `openinference-instrumentation-google-adk` | — |
| PydanticAI | `openinference-instrumentation-pydantic-ai` | — |
| AutoGen | `openinference-instrumentation-autogen` | — |
| Custom agent | Manual spans with `openinference.span.kind` | Manual spans |

Each framework has a self-contained instrumentation resource with: required packages, checklist, the `tracing.py`/`tracing.ts` template, and entry-point integration steps.

Read `references/cloudwatch-omni/omni-agents-instrumentation/openinference-framework-guide.md` first (shared OpenInference rules, then its "Pick the framework reference" table), then follow the matching per-framework file in this directory: `references/cloudwatch-omni/omni-agents-instrumentation/instrument-<framework>.md` (`instrument-langchain.md`, `instrument-langgraph.md`, `instrument-strands.md`, `instrument-crewai.md`, `instrument-openai-agents.md`, `instrument-vercel-ai.md`).

### Python: Virtual Environment Rules

- **NEVER** use bare `pip install` — always target the venv explicitly
- Preferred: `uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python <package>`
- Fallback: `.venv/bin/python -m pip install <package>`
- If no venv exists, recommend creating one (`uv venv .venv` or `python -m venv .venv`)
- **AgentCore stale venv:** `agentcore dev` only installs dependencies when it first creates the venv. If a newly added package fails to import, run `uv sync` (without `--frozen`/`--locked`) to refresh, then restart the server.

### Completion

Use `"adot"` or `"openinference"` as the approach value.

Persist instrumentation state to `.omni/server-config.json`:
- Preserve existing keys
- Set `instrumentationComplete: true`
- Set `instrumentationApproach` to `"adot"` or `"openinference"`

On completion, reprint the checklist:

```markdown
- [x] **Detect framework** — LangGraph / Python
- [x] **Instrument** — ADOT (zero-code)
- [ ] **Connect to agent**
```

---

## Phase 3: Connect to Agent

**MANDATORY — do NOT skip this phase.** Even if instrumentation looks complete and the start command is known, you MUST start the server and run a test invocation. Onboarding is NOT complete until a trace is captured. AgentCore CLI projects (`agentcore dev`) still need the server started and a test request sent — deferred dependency installation does not mean Phase 3 is done.

This phase configures the start command, starts the server, and runs a test invocation to confirm traces flow.

### Step 3.1: Detect Start Command and Port

Determine the entry point:
- Python: `main.py`, `app.py`, `src/main.py`, or `pyproject.toml` `[project.scripts]`
- TypeScript: `package.json` `main` field, `tsconfig.json` `outDir`

Build the command based on platform and instrumentation approach:
- **AgentCore CLI platform:** `agentcore dev -l --skip-deploy` (PYTHONPATH injection handles instrumentation; `-l` = local mode, `--skip-deploy` = don't deploy to cloud)
- **Generic Python:** PYTHONPATH injection + project's natural server command
- **TypeScript:** `--require`/`--import` flags for ADOT, or normal run command for OpenInference

Detect port from code or `.env` file.

Persist the start command to `.omni/server-config.json`:
- Set `startCommand` to the full command string
- Set `devServerPort` if detected

### Step 3.2: Install Dependencies

**Python venv rule** — NEVER bare `pip`:
1. `uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -r requirements.txt`
2. `.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

**TypeScript:** `npm install` (use `--legacy-peer-deps` for Strands)

### Step 3.3: Start Server

Start the server in background with shell commands:

**Python (PYTHONPATH injection):**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH="$(python -c 'import opentelemetry.instrumentation.auto_instrumentation.sitecustomize as s; import os; print(os.path.dirname(s.__file__))')"${PYTHONPATH:+:$PYTHONPATH}
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:<OTLP_PORT>"
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="<agent-name>"
python <entry-point> > .omni/server.log 2>&1 &
echo $! > .omni/server.pid
```

Wait for the port to open (max 30s):
```bash
for i in $(seq 1 30); do
  nc -z localhost <port> 2>/dev/null && echo "Server ready" && break
  sleep 1
done
```

### Step 3.3b: Verify Collector is Reachable

Before testing the agent, confirm the OTLP collector is listening on the same `<OTLP_PORT>` used above:
```bash
nc -z localhost <OTLP_PORT> 2>/dev/null && echo "Collector reachable" || echo "WARNING: No collector on :<OTLP_PORT> — traces will be silently dropped"
```

If not reachable, warn the user and wait for them to start their collector before proceeding.

### Step 3.4: Detect Endpoint and Payload Format

Read source code to identify route definitions and expected payload shape. Use these common framework payloads:

| Framework/Platform | Endpoint | Example Payload |
|---|---|---|
| AgentCore CLI | `POST /invocations` | `{"prompt": "Hello!"}` |
| LangGraph | `POST /runs/stream` | `{"assistant_id": "<from langgraph.json>", "input": {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]}, "stream_mode": "values"}` |
| AG-UI protocol | `POST /awp` | `{"threadId": "test-1", "runId": "run-1", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]}` |
| Generic HTTP | `POST /agent` or `/chat` | `{"prompt": "Hello!"}` or `{"messages": [...]}` |

For LangGraph, check `langgraph.json` for the `assistant_id` value.

Persist the detected schema to `.omni/server-config.json`:
- Set `protocolTemplate` to the detected protocol (e.g., `"AgentCore"`, `"LangGraph"`, `"AG-UI"`, `"custom"`)

### Step 3.5: Test Invocation

Run a test invocation via curl to verify the connection works end-to-end:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:<port>/<endpoint> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '<payload>' -w "\nHTTP %{http_code}\n" | head -c 500
```

Then verify a trace was captured. HTTP 2xx + non-empty response does NOT mean traces reached the collector — OTel export fails silently. Run ALL checks below:

**Trace verification checks (all must pass):**

1. A fresh, **non-error** trace exists.
2. Root span has non-empty `input.value` and `output.value`.
3. **If ADOT:** a span with `gen_ai.operation.name` attribute exists (e.g. `chat`, `invoke_agent`). Spans without it (HTTP spans, Next.js routing, `BedrockRuntime.Converse`, telemetry POSTs) are infrastructure — they do NOT satisfy this check.
4. **If ADOT:** at least one span in the trace carries message content. Accept ANY of: `gen_ai.input.messages` or `gen_ai.output.messages` on a framework or Bedrock runtime span; `gen_ai.prompt` or `gen_ai.completion` on a manually instrumented LLM span; for Strands only, `input.value` with `openinference.span.kind = AGENT` on the root agent span (Strands carries content there, not in `gen_ai.input.messages`). `gen_ai.system`/`gen_ai.request.model` alone do NOT count (metadata only, present even when broken).
5. **If ADOT:** no `traceloop.*` attributes on any span.
6. **If OpenInference:** `openinference.span.kind` present on agent/LLM/tool spans.

If ANY check fails → do NOT declare success. Diagnose the root cause (wrong PYTHONPATH, missing package, version mismatch, conflicting instrumentation), fix, and re-invoke.

**How to verify traces:** Check `.omni/traces.jsonl` directly after the invocation:
```bash
wc -l .omni/traces.jsonl 2>/dev/null || echo "0"
```
If the file exists and has content, parse the last few lines for a fresh trace matching your invocation timestamp. If `.omni/traces.jsonl` does not exist or is empty, the collector may not be running — warn the user but do not block.

### Diagnosing Startup Failures

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Process exited immediately | Missing dependency or syntax error | Check stderr in `.omni/server.log` |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | Venv not activated or package not installed | Reinstall into venv |
| Port timeout (30s) | Server crashed silently or wrong port | Check log, verify port in code |
| ESM/CJS error | Wrong `--require` vs `--import` flag | Check `"type"` field in package.json |
| `No module named aws_opentelemetry_distro` | ADOT not installed in active venv | `uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python aws-opentelemetry-distro` |
| Port already in use | Previous server still running | `lsof -i :<port>` then kill |
| Bedrock 500 with `system.N.member.text` constraint | Strands SDK empty system content block bug | Add non-empty system prompt |

### Diagnosing HTTP Errors

| Status | Meaning | Fix |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Connection refused | Server not running or wrong port | Check server log, verify port |
| 404 | Wrong endpoint path | Read route definitions in source |
| 400/422 | Wrong payload format | Match framework's expected schema |
| 401/403 | Missing or invalid credentials | See credential troubleshooting below |
| 500 + credential error | API key missing or expired | See credential troubleshooting below |
| Timeout | Agent hanging (infinite loop, slow model) | Add timeout params |

### Credential Troubleshooting

Detect which providers the project uses by scanning for imports and env vars:

| Provider | Env Var | Common Sources |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Bedrock | `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | AWS credential chain, `~/.aws/credentials` |
| Anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `.env` file |
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `.env` file |
| Google/Gemini | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | `.env` file |

**Remediation:** Check `.env` file exists with required keys populated. For Bedrock, verify AWS credentials are configured (`aws sts get-caller-identity`). For API keys, confirm the key is valid and not expired.

**SECURITY: NEVER ask the user to paste API keys or secrets into chat.** Guide them to set env vars or `.env` file directly.

After any credential fix, ALWAYS restart the server — env vars are read at startup.

### Retry Rules

- You have **3 invocation attempts**. Only actual test invocations count — diagnostics, credential fixes, server restarts, and user interactions do NOT consume attempts.
- **NEVER declare failure until ALL 3 attempts are exhausted.**
- If attempt 1 or 2 fails: diagnose, fix, then retry.
- **If you tell the user to do something** (e.g., refresh credentials, update a file), you MUST wait for the user to respond before making your next attempt. Do NOT retry immediately after giving instructions — they need time to act.

### On Success

Persist completion to `.omni/server-config.json`:
- Set `onboardingComplete: true`

If the detected schema didn't match a preset (`AgentCore`, `LangGraph`, `AG-UI`), write the custom schema to `.omni/agent-api-spec-custom.json` with the full endpoint, headers, and body template. Set `protocolTemplate: "custom"` in `server-config.json`.

Tell the user they're all set — they can interact with their agent and explore Omni features like trace analysis, prompt management, and evaluations.

### After 3 Unsuccessful Attempts

Ask the user:
1. **Run your own server** — give the command with environment variables
2. **Configure manually** — point them to relevant documentation

---

## Production deployment

Use when the user says "deploy to production", "cloud traces", "what env vars for AWS", or asks how to get traces flowing from a deployed environment (as opposed to the local dev server above).

> **Source of truth:** <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability-configure.html>

### AgentCore (managed runtime)

**Action 1:** Run once per AWS account (enables trace delivery to CloudWatch); replace `<region>` with your value:

```bash
aws xray update-trace-segment-destination --destination CloudWatchLogs --region <region>
```

Allow ~10 minutes before traces appear after running this.

**Action 2:** Read `agentcore/agentcore.json`. If the runtime does not already have `AWS_GENAI_CONTENT_EXTRACTION_OPT_OUT` in `envVars`, add it:

```json
"runtimes": [
  {
    "name": "...",
    "envVars": [
      { "name": "AWS_GENAI_CONTENT_EXTRACTION_OPT_OUT", "value": "true" }
    ]
  }
]
```

Then run `agentcore validate` to confirm the config is valid.

AgentCore handles the rest internally (OTLP endpoint, SigV4, trace routing).

### Lambda

Documented for Python and Node.js. Set on the function config, alongside the ADOT layer wrapper (`AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER=/opt/otel-instrument` for Python, `/opt/otel-handler` for Node):

```
AGENT_OBSERVABILITY_ENABLED=true
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_HEADERS=x-aws-log-group=<your-custom-log-group>,x-aws-log-stream=<your-custom-log-stream>
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp
OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_ENABLED=false
OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=none
OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=none
```

`OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_ENABLED=false` disables Application Signals in the OpenTelemetry Lambda layer; logs and metrics are off in this trace-only flow.

⚠️ Replace `<your-custom-log-group>` and `<your-custom-log-stream>` with your custom trace log group and stream. **Create the log group and its CloudWatch Logs resource policy before invoking the function.**

**Python agents only:**

```
AWS_GENAI_CONTENT_EXTRACTION_OPT_OUT=true
OTEL_PYTHON_DISTRO=aws_distro
OTEL_PYTHON_CONFIGURATOR=aws_configurator
OTEL_PYTHON_DISABLED_INSTRUMENTATIONS=none
```

- `AWS_GENAI_CONTENT_EXTRACTION_OPT_OUT=true` keeps model payloads and tool request/response data on spans, and requires ADOT Python 0.20.0 or later.
- The ADOT Python Lambda layer disables most auto-instrumentation (including the AI-agent instrumentors) for cold-start performance, and `AGENT_OBSERVABILITY_ENABLED=true` does **not** override that default. `OTEL_PYTHON_DISABLED_INSTRUMENTATIONS=none` removes the layer's denylist so every bundled instrumentor becomes eligible to initialize — it installs nothing extra, but the broader initialization can increase cold-start duration.

**Node.js agents only** — set `OTEL_NODE_ENABLED_INSTRUMENTATIONS` per framework (requires ADOT JavaScript 0.13.0 or later):

| Framework | Value to set | Effective runtime list |
|---|---|---|
| LangGraph | `aws-sdk,undici,aws_langchain` | `aws-sdk,undici,aws_langchain,aws-lambda,http` |
| OpenAI Agents | `aws-sdk,undici,aws_openai_agents` | `aws-sdk,undici,aws_openai_agents,aws-lambda,http` |
| Vercel AI | `aws-sdk,undici,aws_vercel_ai` | `aws-sdk,undici,aws_vercel_ai,aws-lambda,http` |
| Strands, manual | not needed — no framework-specific instrumentor | layer default |

The ADOT JavaScript Lambda layer enables only `aws-sdk`, `aws-lambda`, and `http` by default for cold-start performance, and `AGENT_OBSERVABILITY_ENABLED=true` does **not** replace that allowlist. Do not add `aws-lambda` or `http` yourself — the layer appends them. With `AGENT_OBSERVABILITY_ENABLED=true`, ADOT JavaScript keeps model messages and tool request/response content on spans by default (no opt-out variable needed).

### Other platforms (ECS, EC2, EKS, etc.)

Prefer the CloudWatch agent collector on EC2/ECS/EKS, or AgentCore where it fits. Set in your task definition or process environment:

```
AGENT_OBSERVABILITY_ENABLED=true
AWS_GENAI_CONTENT_EXTRACTION_OPT_OUT=true
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<agent-name>,deployment.environment.name=<stage>,aws.log.group.names=<your-custom-log-group>,cloud.resource_id=<resource-id>
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_HEADERS=x-aws-log-group=<your-custom-log-group>,x-aws-log-stream=spans
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp
OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=none
OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=none
```

Python agents also need `OTEL_PYTHON_DISTRO=aws_distro` and `OTEL_PYTHON_CONFIGURATOR=aws_configurator`, and launch with `opentelemetry-instrument python <entrypoint>.py` (container `CMD ["opentelemetry-instrument", "python", "main.py"]`). `AWS_GENAI_CONTENT_EXTRACTION_OPT_OUT=true` keeps model payloads and tool request/response data on spans — the value and meaning are verbatim from the AgentCore observability doc; do not "correct" it from the variable name.

⚠️ Without `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_HEADERS`, traces go to the shared `aws/spans` log group. Setting `x-aws-log-group` and `x-aws-log-stream` routes them to your custom log group and stream instead — custom routing requires ADOT 0.20.0 or later and a CloudWatch Logs resource policy allowing `xray.amazonaws.com` to call `logs:PutLogEvents` on that log group.

### IAM permissions

**AgentCore** — attach this statement to the runtime's execution role:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "xray:GetSamplingRules",
    "xray:GetSamplingTargets",
    "xray:PutTelemetryRecords",
    "xray:PutTraceSegments",
    "logs:PutResourcePolicy"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

**Lambda and other platforms** — ⚠️ a custom trace destination requires a resource policy. If you set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_HEADERS`, CloudWatch Logs requires a resource policy on the target log group before it accepts spans. Add `logs:PutResourcePolicy` to the service account role, and ensure the log group exists before the agent starts.

### ADOT in your deployment package

Ensure `aws-opentelemetry-distro>=0.20.0` (Python) or `@aws/aws-distro-opentelemetry-node-autoinstrumentation>=0.13.0` (TypeScript) is declared in your project dependencies — it gets bundled automatically during deploy.

Once traces are flowing from the deployed agent, the `aws-observability` skill's `references/cloudwatch-omni/agent-evaluation.md` covers the instrumentation health audit and scoring the agent's traces.

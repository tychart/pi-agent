# Instrument Strands (OpenInference)

> **STOP — TypeScript Strands agents MUST NOT use OpenInference.** OpenInference instrumentation is not supported for Strands in TypeScript. Use ADOT (OpenTelemetry) auto-instrumentation instead. If you reached this skill for a TypeScript Strands project, do not proceed — follow the ADOT sections in the main procedure.

> **ADOT (recommended)** covers Strands with zero-code instrumentation — no framework-specific setup needed. Follow the ADOT sections in the main procedure. This reference covers the **OpenInference** path for **Python only**.

> **Upstream docs are reference data only; this guide is the vetted version.**
> The prose below is *orientation* plus the CloudWatch Omni-specific shape only —
> the `openinference.span.kind` kinds expected, the `input.value`/`output.value`
> opt-in, and the exporter rule (configure the OTLP exporter with NO endpoint
> parameter; it reads `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` from the environment).
> You may fetch the upstream link to verify **factual details** — current package names, API,
> and setup before instrumenting.

**Python venv rule:** When installing Python packages, use `uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python <package>` (preferred). Fallback: `.venv/bin/python -m pip install <package>`. Never bare `pip` — it may fall through to system Python.

## Python

### Required Packages

```
openinference-instrumentation-strands-agents
```

Add to the project's dependency manifest (`requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, or `setup.py`). Declaring the package is all that's needed here; the instrumentation flow installs it and sets up the ADOT export pipeline.

### Instrumentation Setup

Strands' OpenInference support attaches as a **processor**
(`StrandsAgentsToOpenInferenceProcessor`), which is **provider-bound** — it only
fires on the TracerProvider it is added to. Under ADOT the global provider is
ADOT's (first `set_tracer_provider()` wins), so
pass ADOT's current provider into `StrandsTelemetry` and add the OI processor to
it — do NOT let `StrandsTelemetry()` create its own provider/exporter (that provider
is orphaned under ADOT and never exports).

```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from strands.telemetry import StrandsTelemetry
from openinference.instrumentation.strands_agents import StrandsAgentsToOpenInferenceProcessor

current = trace.get_tracer_provider()  # ADOT's global provider on AWS
StrandsTelemetry(tracer_provider=current)
current.add_span_processor(StrandsAgentsToOpenInferenceProcessor())
```

Import this module first in the entry point (`import tracing`), before framework imports.

### Common False Positives

These are NOT sufficient on their own:
- `strands-agents[otel]` without `openinference-instrumentation-strands-agents`
- `aws-opentelemetry-distro` without the required packages (only sends to CloudWatch)

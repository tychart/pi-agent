# Instrument a .NET Lambda Function with ADOT

Add the ADOT .NET Lambda layer to a function so it emits OpenTelemetry traces, with Application Signals explicitly disabled.

Read [instrumentation.md](instrumentation.md) first. Note that **Lambda differs from the other platforms**: the Lambda execution environment supplies its own X-Ray receiver, and with active tracing enabled the layer exports traces to it — so the function's export path is already wired rather than left at the SDK default. That is why this guide keeps the layer's standard configuration instead of omitting endpoint setup entirely.

If you cannot determine a value (such as the AWS Region), ask the user. Do not guess.

## Critical Requirements

**Do NOT:**

- Set `OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_ENABLED=true`, or add `OTEL_AWS_SERVICE_EVENTS_*` / `OTEL_AWS_DYNAMIC_INSTRUMENTATION_*` variables
- Add `CloudWatchLambdaApplicationSignalsExecutionRolePolicy` — it grants Application Signals, which is disabled here
- Hardcode a layer version from this guide
- Set the `CORECLR_*` / `DOTNET_*` variables by hand — the layer's wrapper configures the profiler
- Run `terraform apply`, `cdk deploy`, or `sam deploy` automatically
- Modify the function's handler source or its `.csproj`

## Layer ARN

The ADOT Lambda layer ARN is region-specific and its **layer version changes over time**. Look up the current value rather than copying one from this guide:

- Latest Version Reference: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-otel/aws-otel.github.io/refs/heads/main/src/config/lambdaLayerArns.js
- (Human-readable: https://github.com/aws-otel/aws-otel.github.io/blob/main/src/config/lambdaLayerArns.js)

ARN format — fill in `<REGION>`, `<ACCOUNT_ID>`, and `<LAYER_VERSION>` from the source above:

```
arn:aws:lambda:<REGION>:<ACCOUNT_ID>:layer:AWSOpenTelemetryDistroDotNet:<LAYER_VERSION>
```

Sample regions (illustrative — confirm the current version and account ID, and use the source of truth for **any** supported region, not just these):

```
us-east-1:      arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:615299751070:layer:AWSOpenTelemetryDistroDotNet:<LAYER_VERSION>
us-west-2:      arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:615299751070:layer:AWSOpenTelemetryDistroDotNet:<LAYER_VERSION>
ap-east-1:      arn:aws:lambda:ap-east-1:888577020596:layer:AWSOpenTelemetryDistroDotNet:<LAYER_VERSION>
eu-south-1:     arn:aws:lambda:eu-south-1:257394471194:layer:AWSOpenTelemetryDistroDotNet:<LAYER_VERSION>
...
```

> Some partitions use a different prefix and account ID (`arn:aws-cn:` for China). The source of truth has the exact ARN per region.

## Step 1: Add the layer

**CDK:**

```typescript
// lambda-stack.ts
const myFunction = new lambda.Function(this, 'MyFunction', {
  // ... existing runtime, handler, code unchanged ...
  layers: [
    lambda.LayerVersion.fromLayerVersionArn(this, 'AdotLayer', adotLayerArn),
  ],
});
```

**Terraform:**

```hcl
# lambda.tf
resource "aws_lambda_function" "my_function" {
  # ... existing configuration unchanged ...
  layers = [local.adot_layer_arn]
}
```

Layers apply to `.zip` deployment packages. If the function is packaged as a **container image**, layers are not available — instrument the image instead using the pattern in [ecs-dotnet.md](ecs-dotnet.md) (the same ADOT .NET SDK and CoreCLR variables), and tell the user that the image has to be rebuilt.

## Step 2: Enable X-Ray active tracing

Retained from the standard ADOT Lambda setup — active tracing is what makes the execution environment's X-Ray receiver available, so the layer's export path depends on it.

**CDK:** `tracing: lambda.Tracing.ACTIVE`
**Terraform:** `tracing_config { mode = "Active" }`

## Step 3: Set the environment variables

```
AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER              = /opt/otel-instrument
OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_ENABLED = false
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME                    = <function-name>
```

`AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER` is what loads the SDK — without it the layer is inert. On .NET it is also what sets up the CoreCLR profiler variables, so do not write those by hand. `OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_ENABLED=false` is **required, not stylistic**. The layer's `otel-instrument` wrapper defaults this variable to `true` when it is unset — every ADOT Lambda runtime does — so taking the defaults would silently ENABLE Application Signals, which is out of scope here. This is the one place in this reference where an `OTEL_AWS_*` variable is written deliberately, and it must not be omitted.

`OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` is optional: the wrapper already defaults it to `$AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME`. Set it only if the service should be named something other than the function. `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER` and `OTEL_PROPAGATORS` are also defaulted sensibly by the wrapper, so do not set them.

**CDK:**

```typescript
environment: {
  AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER: '/opt/otel-instrument',
  OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_ENABLED: 'false',
  OTEL_SERVICE_NAME: 'my-function',
},
```

**Terraform:**

```hcl
environment {
  variables = {
    AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER              = "/opt/otel-instrument"
    OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_ENABLED = "false"
    OTEL_SERVICE_NAME                    = "my-function"
  }
}
```

Preserve any environment variables the function already sets — append to them.

## Step 4: Grant X-Ray write permissions to the execution role

With active tracing and the layer's default configuration, traces reach X-Ray through the execution environment's X-Ray receiver, so the execution role needs `xray:PutTraceSegments` and `xray:PutTelemetryRecords`. `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` does not include them.

**CDK — already handled by Step 2.** Setting `tracing` to anything other than `DISABLED` makes the `Function` construct add those two actions to the role as an inline statement. Do not attach `AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess` on top of that; confirm the grant with `cdk diff` instead.

**Terraform:**

```hcl
# lambda.tf
resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "lambda_xray" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.lambda_exec.name
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess"
}
```

**SAM:** add `AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess` to the function's `Policies` list. **CloudFormation, or a console-managed function:** attach the same managed policy to the execution role.

`AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess` is broader than what the function actually uses — it also permits sampling-rule reads. If the user prefers least privilege, an inline policy with just the two `xray:Put*` actions covers this configuration.

## A note on IAM

The X-Ray permissions in Step 4 are the only ones this instrumentation needs, and they are added here because they follow directly from active tracing on the function itself.

Do not add `CloudWatchLambdaApplicationSignalsExecutionRolePolicy` — it exists to grant Application Signals, which this configuration disables.

If the function is later pointed at a **different** destination — such as a customer-run collector — the permissions for that destination are not decided here.

## Expect no traces until a destination exists

**This runtime behaves differently from the other three, and the difference is silent.**
The .NET layer's `otel-instrument` wrapper contains:

```sh
if [ -z "${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT}" ] && [ -z "${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT}" ]; then
  export OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER="none";
fi
```

So when no OTLP endpoint is configured — which is exactly the state this guide leaves the
function in — the wrapper **forces the traces exporter off**. Instrumentation still loads
and the profiler still attaches; spans are simply created and dropped. The function looks
healthy and logs nothing unusual.

The other runtimes do not do this: the Python and Node.js wrappers leave
`OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER` alone, and the Java wrapper only defaults it
(`${OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER:-"otlp"}`), so those three attempt to export and surface
connection errors instead.

Consequence: for .NET, "instrumentation applied" does **not** mean "traces flowing". It
starts working once an OTLP endpoint exists and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (or
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT`) points at it. Say this to the
user explicitly, so a silent absence of traces is not mistaken for a broken setup.

## Verify

Invoke the function and check its CloudWatch Logs. The layer logs that the ADOT/OpenTelemetry instrumentation initialized on cold start.

If nothing is logged, the usual cause is a missing or misspelled `AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER` — the profiler then never attaches and the function runs normally with no instrumentation and no error.

Note that a `not a dynamic executable` line at `INIT_START` is harmless — it is `ldd` output
from the wrapper's glibc/musl detection, not a failure.

## Completion

**Tell the user:**

"I've added ADOT .NET instrumentation to your Lambda function.

**Changes:**
- Added the `AWSOpenTelemetryDistroDotNet` layer (version looked up from the ADOT source of truth for your region)
- Enabled X-Ray active tracing
- Set `AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER`, `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`, and `OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_ENABLED=false`
- Granted the execution role X-Ray write permissions — inline, via CDK's `tracing` setting, or the `AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess` managed policy for Terraform/SAM/CloudFormation

**Not changed:** your handler source and `.csproj`. The CoreCLR profiler variables are configured by the layer's wrapper, so none were written into your IaC, and no Application Signals policy was added.

**Next steps:**
1. Review the diff and confirm the layer version and region are right.
2. Deploy, then invoke the function once to trigger a cold start.
3. **No traces will appear yet, and that is expected for .NET specifically.** The .NET layer's wrapper forces `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=none` while no OTLP endpoint is set, so spans are created and dropped rather than exported. Configuring a destination — such as a collector — is what turns traces on, and its permissions differ from the X-Ray ones added here.

Let me know if you'd like adjustments before you deploy."
